C Implementation from scratch of metaheuristic algorithms harmony search, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.

Used to optimize the fine tuning process of PID controller parameters for speed and motion control of robotic arm. 
Example performance values are randomly generated and to be replaced by actual measured values when running tests on physical robotic arm
